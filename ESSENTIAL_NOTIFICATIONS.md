## 📝 Implementation Notes

- **Email frequency**: Critical notifications should be sent immediately
- **Email templates**: Should be clear, actionable, and include relevant order/transaction details

- **Unsubscribe options**: Provide granular unsubscribe preferences for optional notifications
- **Multi-channel**: Critical notifications should be sent via both email and in-app for redundancy
